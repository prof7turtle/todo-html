# PM-AJAY Solution Approach

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a targeted approach to solve the mapping and coordination challenges in the PM-AJAY (Pradhan Mantri Anusuchit Jaati Abhyuday Yojna) implementation. The solution focuses on creating a unified digital platform that addresses the specific coordination issues between the Department of Social Justice & Empowerment, State/UT governments, and multiple executing agencies across the three components: Adarsh Gram, GIA, and Hostel.

## Problem Analysis

### Core Issues Identified (Based on Current PM-AJAY Implementation)

1. **Agency Mapping and Coordination Gap**
   - No centralized mapping of executing agencies across 28 States/UTs
   - Multiple agencies working on different components without coordination
   - Unclear role definitions between State Treasury, implementing departments, and executing agencies
   - Two-tier approval system creating coordination bottlenecks

2. **Communication and Information Flow Issues**
   - Manual coordination through VC/WhatsApp lacking systematic approach
   - Inconsistent communication between DoSJE, States, and executing agencies
   - Fragmented information systems (separate portals for different components)
   - No standardized reporting mechanisms

3. **Fund Flow and Transparency Challenges**
   - State Treasury delays in releasing funds to implementation departments
   - No real-time tracking of Rs. 100+ crore annual budget allocation
   - Significant unspent balances (Rs. 106,687.81 lakh in 2021-22)
   - Poor budget planning at state level

4. **Performance and Accountability Issues**
   - Inconsistent state-wise performance (some states showing zero utilization)
   - Limited visibility into work allocation and progress across components
   - Manual monitoring processes inadequate for 47,512 villages coverage
   - Administrative delays in responsibility assignment
