# PM-AJAY Research Documentation


### Background
**PM-AJAY (Pradhan Mantri Anusuchit Jaati Abhyuday Yojna)** is implemented by the Department of Social Justice & Empowerment, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. The scheme consists of three main components:

1. **Adarsh Gram** - Development of SC dominated villages into model villages
2. **GIA (Grants-in-Aid)** - Financial assistance to State/Districts for livelihood and infrastructure projects
3. **Hostel** - Construction/Repair of hostels for SC students

These components are implemented by State/UT governments and executed through multiple agencies, leading to coordination challenges.

#### PM-AJAY Implementation Structure

**Current Implementation Framework:**
```
Department of Social Justice & Empowerment (DoSJE)
    ↓
State/UT Governments (28 States/UTs)
    ↓
District Level Implementation
    ↓
Multiple Executing Agencies
    ↓
SC Beneficiaries
```

**Key Stakeholders Identified:**
- **Central Level**: Department of Social Justice & Empowerment, Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
- **State Level**: Principal Secretary (receives login credentials), State Treasury, State Scheduled Caste Corporations
- **District Level**: District implementation departments, Project creation and approval officers
- **Local Level**: Panchayati Raj institutions, Implementing agencies
- **Executing Agencies**: NGOs, Contractors, Educational institutions, Development agencies
- **Monitoring**: State and District level monitoring officers, NIC technical team

### Identified Challenges (Based on PM-AJAY Current Implementation)

#### 1. Agency Mapping and Coordination Issues
- **Multiple Executing Agencies**: States have various agencies executing different components without clear mapping
- **Decentralized Planning**: Two-level approval system (creation and approval) creates coordination gaps
- **Role Clarity**: Unclear responsibilities between State Treasury, implementing departments, and executing agencies
- **Communication Breakdown**: No centralized communication system between Centre, States, and executing agencies

#### 2. Current Implementation Bottlenecks
- **Fund Release Delays**: State Treasury not releasing funds to implementation departments (observed in Karnataka and other states)
- **Poor Budgetary Planning**: States struggle with proper budget allocation and planning
- **Low Adoption**: Meager subsidy of Rs. 10,000 not incentivizing beneficiaries
- **Annual Action Plan Issues**: Only 27 out of 28 states submitted AAPs in 2020-21

#### 3. Performance and Monitoring Gaps
- **Inconsistent Performance**: Significant variation in state-wise performance and fund utilization
- **Poor Performing States**: Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra identified as underperforming
- **Monitoring Limitations**: Manual monitoring through VC/WhatsApp, lacking systematic approach
- **Real-time Tracking**: No digital dashboard for real-time project and fund monitoring

#### 4. System and Process Issues
- **Technology Gap**: Web-based system developed but not fully operational
- **Data Fragmentation**: Separate portals for different components (pmajay.dosje.gov.in, pmagy.gov.in)
- **Accountability Issues**: Administrative delays in assigning clear responsibilities
- **Transparency Deficit**: Limited visibility into fund flow and work allocation status

### Current Scheme Performance and Status

#### Financial Performance (2018-2022)
- **Budget Allocation**: Rs. 100-119 crore annually
- **Fund Utilization**: Varies significantly by state
- **Poor Performing States**: Multiple states showing zero or low utilization
- **Unspent Balance**: Rs. 106,687.81 lakh across states (2021-22)

#### Implementation Statistics
- **Adarsh Gram**: 47,512 villages, 45,83,970 beneficiaries, 41,430 works completed
- **Geographic Coverage**: 26 states, 596 districts
- **Target vs Achievement**: Significant gaps in various indicators

### Current Digital Infrastructure

#### Existing Systems
1. **PM-AJAY Portal**: pmajay.dosje.gov.in (partially operational)
2. **PMAGY Portal**: pmagy.gov.in (Adarsh Gram specific)
3. **Web-based System**: Developed by NIC team for decentralized planning
4. **Features**: Project creation, approval, submission, evaluation, financial tracking

#### System Limitations
- **Fragmented Portals**: Different systems for different components
- **Limited Integration**: No unified view of all activities
- **Manual Processes**: Heavy reliance on offline coordination
- **Reporting Gaps**: Inconsistent data reporting across states

### Key Insights for Solution Development

#### Critical Success Factors
1. **Unified Digital Platform**: Single system for all three components
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live tracking of projects, funds, and performance
3. **Agency Mapping**: Clear database of all implementing and executing agencies
4. **Communication Hub**: Centralized communication system for all stakeholders
5. **Transparency Dashboard**: Public visibility into scheme progress and fund utilization

#### Immediate Requirements
1. **Agency Database**: Comprehensive mapping of all stakeholders
2. **Role Definition**: Clear responsibilities for each agency level
3. **Communication System**: Standardized protocols for information flow
4. **Fund Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of budget allocation and utilization
5. **Performance Metrics**: Consistent KPIs across all states and components

### Conclusion

The research confirms that PM-AJAY is a substantial scheme targeting SC community development through three distinct components. The identified challenges align perfectly with the problem statement, highlighting the urgent need for a centralized mapping and coordination system to improve implementation efficiency and accountability.

**Key Finding**: The scheme has existing digital infrastructure but lacks integration and comprehensive agency mapping, making it an ideal candidate for the proposed solution.
