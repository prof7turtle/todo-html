- **Context API**: State management
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: JWT-based login with role assignment
2. **Route Protection**: Role-based dashboard routing
3. **API Calls**: Authenticated requests with permission checks
4. **Data Display**: Role-appropriate data filtering and presentation
5. **Actions**: Permission-based action availability

## Deployment Ready Features

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Configurable API endpoints
- Environment-based settings
- Development vs production modes

### 2. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback UI components
- API error handling

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for dashboard components
- Efficient API calls with pagination
- Optimized re-renders with proper key usage
- Memory-efficient state management

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Server Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start  # Server runs on port 5000
```

### 2. Database Seeding
```bash
cd server
node seedData.js  # Populates database with sample data
```

### 3. Client Setup
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev  # Client runs on port 3000
```

### 4. Login Credentials
The seeder creates users for each role. Default login format:
- **Username**: role-specific (e.g., central.admin@pmajay.gov.in)
- **Password**: password123 (for all seeded users)

## Role-Specific Features

### Central Admin
